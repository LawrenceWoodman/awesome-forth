# Awesome Forth

Resources and links for the Forth programming language

## Getting started

I recommend trying GForth which is a cross platform forth compiler. It seemed to be the easiest version to install on OSX and can be installed with Homebrew.

```
brew install gforth

# Once installed, type gforth to start an interactive session
```
